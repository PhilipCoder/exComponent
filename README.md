## What is ex-elements?
Extended elements or ex-elements is a library that uses the power of HTML custom elements (not to be confused with web-components) to create a simple to use but powerful web-framework. Custom elements are not supported by Safari by default, but ex-elements include a custom element polyfill for Safari.
